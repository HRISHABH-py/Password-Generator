Password Combination Generator

This Python script generates a comprehensive list of password combinations based on user inputs, including a name, age, and date of birth (DOB). It supports customizable patterns and integrates special characters and numerical sequences for enhanced variety.
Features

User Input Processing:
        Accepts input in the format: name,age,DOB (e.g., John,25,11-12-1998).
        Processes the name into various formats (uppercase, lowercase, swap case).
        Handles and validates DOB as integers split by -.

Custom Combinations:
        Generates numerical combinations derived from the DOB.
        Incorporates a pre-stored list of numerical data from numerical.txt.
        Combines inputs with a set of special characters to generate unique passkeys.

Progress Tracking:
        Displays a dynamic progress bar to track the password generation process.

File Handling:
        Reads supplementary numerical data from numerical.txt.
        Writes all generated passwords into a file named pass.txt.

How It Works

The user inputs a name, age, and DOB as comma-separated values.
    The script processes the inputs and creates variations of the name.
    Passwords are generated by combining:
        Variations of the name.
        A set of predefined special characters.
        Numerical sequences derived from the DOB and the external file (numerical.txt).
    A progress bar updates periodically to indicate generation status.
    All passwords longer than six characters are saved to pass.txt.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.
A file named numerical.txt containing numerical sequences (one per line).

Usage

   Clone the repository or download the script.
   Create a file named numerical.txt with some numerical values (e.g., 12345).
   Run the script and follow the input prompt.
   The generated passwords will be saved in pass.txt.

Notes

Ensure the inputs are in the correct format, as specified in the script.
Large input datasets may take longer to process due to the extensive combination generation.
